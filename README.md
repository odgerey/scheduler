This project introduces REACT as well as the Jest Test Framework.It is a single page app and was developed incrementally using Storybook as a tool. Full testing has been completed throughout the project phases, first with static testing (ESlint), unit testing (Building hooks), integration testing, and end-to-end testing with Cypress. Core functionalities work. There are no known bugs at this time.
